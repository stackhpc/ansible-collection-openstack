OpenStack Flavors
=================

This role can be used to register flavors in Nova and map them to projects
using the `openstack.cloud.compute_flavor` module.

Requirements
------------

The OpenStack Nova API should be accessible from the target host.

Role Variables
--------------

`os_flavors_venv` is a path to a directory in which to create a
virtualenv.

`os_flavors_auth_type` is an authentication type compatible with
the `auth_type` argument of `openstack.cloud` Ansible modules.

`os_flavors_auth` is a dict containing authentication information
compatible with the `auth` argument of `openstack.cloud` Ansible modules.

`os_flavors_cacert` is an optional path to a CA certificate bundle.

`os_flavors_interface` is the endpoint URL type to fetch from the service
catalog. Maybe be one of `public`, `admin`, or `internal`.

`os_flavors` is a list of Nova flavors to register. Each item should be a dict
containing the items 'name', 'ram', 'disk', and 'vcpus'. Optionally, the dict
may contain 'ephemeral', 'flavorid', 'rxtx_factor' and 'swap' items.
Optionally, the dict may also contain an item 'extra_specs', which is a dict of
metadata to attach to the flavor object.

`is_public` default is `true`. It is a mandatory parameter when mapping flavor
to project, and it have to be set to `false` in that case. Non public 
flavor can't be mapped.  However there is possibility to create flavor which 
is private and not mapped to any project. Only 'true' and 'false' are 
allowed here.

`project` single value, or list of projects, to which flavor should be mapped. 
In other words: this flavor will be visible and usable only in said project(s).


Dependencies
------------

This role depends on the `stackhpc.openstack.os_openstacksdk` role.

Example Playbook
----------------

The following playbook registers a Nova flavor.

    ---
    - name: Ensure Nova flavors are registered
      hosts: localhost
      roles:
        - role: stackhpc.openstack.os_flavors
          os_flavors_venv: "~/os-flavors-venv"
          os_flavors_auth_type: "password"
          os_flavors_auth:
            project_name: <keystone project>
            username: <keystone user>
            password: <keystone password>
            auth_url: <keystone auth URL>
          os_flavors:
            - name: flavor-1
              ram: 1024
              disk: 1024
              vcpus: 2
              extra_specs:
                hw:cpu_policy: "dedicated"
                hw:numa_nodes: "1"

The following playbook will allow uasge of `flavor-1` only in project `projectA`.

    - name: Map Nova flavors to projects
      hosts: localhost
      roles:
        - role: openstack.cloud.compute_flavor_access
          os_flavors_venv: "~/os-flavors-venv"
          os_flavors_auth_type: "password"
          os_flavors_auth:
            project_name: <keystone project>
            username: <keystone user>
            password: <keystone password>
            auth_url: <keystone auth URL>
          os_flavors:
            - name: flavor-1
              is_public: false
              project: "projectA"
